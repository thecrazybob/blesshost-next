                As a provider of web site hosting and other Internet-related
                services, BlessHost offers its customer (also known as
                "Subscribers") and their customers and users the means to
                acquire and disseminate a wealth of public, private, commercial
                and non-commercial information. BlessHost respects that the
                Internet provides a forum for free and open discussion and
                dissemination of information. However, when there are competing
                interests at issue, BlessHost reserves the right to take certain
                preventive or corrective actions. In order to protect these
                competing interests, BlessHost has developed an&nbsp;
                <strong class="leading-10 border-b text-lg">
                    Acceptable Use Policy ("AUP")
                </strong>
                , which supplements and explains certain terms of each
                customer's respective service agreement, and is intended as a
                guide to the customer's rights and obligations when using
                BlessHost' services. This AUP will be revised from time to time.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-3">
                One important aspect of the Internet is that no one party owns
                or controls it. This fact accounts for much of the Internet's
                openness and value, but it also places a high premium on the
                judgment and responsibility of those who use it, both in the
                information they acquire and in the information they disseminate
                to others. When subscribers obtain information through the
                Internet, they must keep in mind that BlessHost cannot monitor,
                verify, warrant or vouch for the accuracy and quality of the
                information they acquire. For this reason, the subscriber must
                exercise his or her best judgment in relying on information
                obtained from the Internet, and also should be aware that some
                material posted to the Internet may be sexually explicit or
                otherwise offensive. Because BlessHost cannot monitor or censor
                the Internet, and will not attempt to do so, BlessHost cannot
                accept any responsibility for injury to its subscribers
                resulting from inaccurate, unsuitable, offensive or illegal
                Internet communications.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-3">
                When subscribers disseminate information from the Internet, they
                must keep in mind that BlessHost does not review, edit, censor
                or take responsibility for any information its subscribers may
                create. When users place information on the Internet, they have
                the same liability as other authors for copyright infringement,
                defamation and other harmful speech. Also, because the
                information created is carried over BlessHost' network and may
                reach a large number of people, including both subscribers and
                non-subscribers of BlessHost, subscribers' postings to the
                Internet may affect other subscribers and may affect BlessHost'
                goodwill, business, reputation or operations. For these reasons,
                subscribers violate BlessHost policy and the Service Agreement
                when they, their customers, affiliates or subsidiaries engage in
                the following prohibited activities:

                Sending unsolicited bulk and/or commercial information over the
                Internet. It is not only harmful because of its negative impact
                on consumer attitudes toward BlessHost, but also because it can
                overload BlessHost' network and disrupt service to BlessHost'
                subscribers. Also, maintaining an open SMTP relay is prohibited.
                When a complaint is received, BlessHost will investigate and
                shutdown the account that is SPAMing. A $250 charge for
                violating this policy will be charged to the person initiating
                the SPAM. Furthermore BlessHost reserves the right to prosecute
                for this violation. A $1.00 charge will be assessed PER EMAIL
                sent should BlessHost choose to pursue and prosecute.

                As we have pointed out, the responsibility for avoiding harmful
                activities just described rests primarily with the subscriber.
                BlessHost will not, as an ordinary practice, monitor the
                communications of its subscribers to ensure that comply with
                BlessHost' policy or applicable law. However, when BlessHost
                becomes aware of harmful activities, it may take any action to
                stop the harmful activity, including, but not limited to,
                removal of information, shutting down a web site, implementing
                screening software designed to block offending transmissions,
                denying access to the Internet, or any other action deemed
                appropriate by BlessHost.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-3">
                BlessHost is also aware that many of its subscribers are
                themselves providers of Internet services, and that information
                reaching BlessHost' facilities from those subscribers may have
                originated from a customer of the subscriber or from another
                third party. BlessHost does not require its subscribers who
                offer Internet services to monitor or censor transmissions or
                web sites created by customers of its subscribers. BlessHost
                reserves the right to directly take action against a customer of
                its subscribers. Also, BlessHost may take action against the
                BlessHost' subscriber because of activities of a customer of the
                subscriber, even though the action may affect other customers of
                the subscriber. Similarly, BlessHost anticipates that
                subscribers who offer Internet services will cooperate with
                BlessHost in any corrective or preventive action that BlessHost
                deems necessary. Failure to cooperate with such corrective or
                preventive measures is a violation of BlessHost policy.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-3">
                BlessHost will not intentionally monitor private electronic mail
                messages sent or receive by its subscribers, unless required to
                do so by law, governmental authority or when public safety is at
                stake. BlessHost may, however, monitor its service
                electronically to determine that its facilities are operating
                satisfactorily. Also, BlessHost may disclose information,
                including, but not limited to, information concerning a
                subscriber, a transmission made using our network, or a web
                site, in order to comply with a court order, subpoena, summons,
                discovery request, warrant, statute, regulation or governmental
                request. BlessHost assumes no obligation to inform the
                subscriber that subscriber information has been provided and, in
                some cases, may be prohibited by law from giving such notice.
                Finally, BlessHost may disclose subscriber information or
                information transmitted over its network where necessary to
                protect BlessHost and others from harm, or where such disclosure
                is necessary to the proper operation of the system. However,
                BlessHost will never sell information to other services or
                outside companies.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-3">
                BlessHost expects that its subscribers who provide Internet
                services to others will comply fully with all applicable laws
                concerning the privacy of online communications. A subscriber's
                failure to comply with those laws will violate BlessHost policy.
                Finally, BlessHost wishes to emphasize that, in signing the
                Service Agreement, subscribers indemnify BlessHost for any
                violation of the Service Agreement, law or BlessHost policy
                resulting in loss to BlessHost or the bringing of any claim
                against BlessHost by any third party. This means that, if
                BlessHost is sued because of a subscriber's or customer of a
                subscriber's activity, the subscriber will be responsible for
                payment of any damages awarded against BlessHost, plus costs and
                reasonable attorney's fees.

                We hope this AUP is helpful in clarifying the obligations of
                Internet users, including BlessHost and its subscribers, as
                responsible members of the Internet. Any complaints about a
